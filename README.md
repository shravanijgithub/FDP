The food delivery time prediction model is essential in the food delivery industry, where timely and accurate deliveries are critical for customer satisfaction and overall experience.

To create an effective prediction model, we started by meticulously cleaning the dataset to eliminate errors and inconsistencies, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the predictions.

Next, we used feature engineering to derive valuable insights from the dataset. By considering factors such as the delivery person's age, ratings, location coordinates, and time-related variables, we aimed to identify key elements that affect delivery time. These engineered features enhanced the model's predictive power.

We then built the predictive model using regression algorithms like linear regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost. The model was trained on a subset of the dataset using cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness. We evaluated the model's accuracy with metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score.

This food delivery time prediction model enables businesses to optimize their operations and enhance the overall delivery experience for their customers.
